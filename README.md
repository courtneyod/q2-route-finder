**About**

Route Finder is a platform for users to discover bike rides around them, record new bikes rides, and view past rides recorded or favorited.

Users can record new rides on the app (using Sockets) and view them later on their dashboard. Users can also search for new rides based on their preferred location, distance, and climb. The app also pulls in any Strava data so they can view all their activity and discovered rides in one place.
